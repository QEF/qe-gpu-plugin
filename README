QE-GPU: GPU-Accelerated Quantum ESPRESSO
----------------------------------------

Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for 
electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. 

The aim of QE-GPU is to create a "plugin-like" component for the standard 
Quantum ESPRESSO package that allows to exploit the capabilities of NVIDIA 
GPU graphics cards in order to allow materials scientists to do better and 
fast science. GPU acceleration is currently available for the Plane-Wave 
Self-Consistent Field (PWscf) code and the energy barriers and reaction 
pathways through the Nudged Elastic Band method (NEB) package.
