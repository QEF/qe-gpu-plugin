To apply the patch first copy the appropriate file (according to the version 
of both QE and QE-GPU) in the main espresso directory and run the command:

$ patch -p1 < name-of-the-patch.patch


IMPORTANT NOTE: 
if the patch does not work or it produces errors at compile time that are not 
expected or a weird behavior is obtained at run-time _PLEASE_ upgrade
your espresso to the latest stable version or try to compile espresso from
the SVN repository.
